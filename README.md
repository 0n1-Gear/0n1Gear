# 0n1Gear

## Intro
A community led project to add Loot style "gear" to 0N1 Force

## Getting things working locally
* Install Node globally if not already installed
* Install Truffle framework globally: https://www.trufflesuite.com/
* Install Ganache: https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
* Pull repo
* Install dependencies with npm install
* Check truffle-config.js matches local Ganache config (port etc for local blockchain)
* run "truffle test" from a terminal to run the tests
* run "truffle console" to run the truffle console where you can test deployment with "truffle migrate"

## Future plans
Consider using the project to generate funds which can create a liquidity pool and floor stabiliser for 0N1 Force.
