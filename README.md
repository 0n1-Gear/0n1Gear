A community led project to add Loot style "gear" to 0N1 Force

## Getting things working locally

* Pull repo
* Install dependencies with npm install
* run "npx hardhat test" from a terminal to run the tests and show estimated gas

## Data source
Currently using https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D7VDI3YSqBsxjhD9VF2O7ArtYO2D1sMQy6tfHUD9lLQ/edit?usp=sharing as the source sheet for traits data

## Future plans
Consider using the project to generate funds which can create a liquidity pool and floor stabiliser for 0N1 Force.
